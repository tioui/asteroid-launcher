This is a modification of the original asteroid-launcher used to replace the
lock button in the quick settings for a sleep toggle button. The sleep toggle
button is used to desactivate the "tilt-to-wake" functionnality of the watch.

Asteroid-launcher is a wayland compositor which uses Lipstick from NemoMobile which
itself uses QML, QtWayland, QPA etc... It is designed to provide a smartwatch UX
for the AsteroidOS project.

Asteroid-launcher is released under the BSD license and is based on Glacier-Home 
(released under the BSD license) which is itself based on 
lipstick-colorful-home(released under MIT provided in COPYING.MIT).
